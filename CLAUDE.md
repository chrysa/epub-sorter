# epub-sorter — Claude context

> **Claude Code**: also read `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` for code specifications.

## What does this project do?

Python tool for organizing and deduplicating EPUB ebook libraries. Reads EPUB metadata (author, title, identifier) and performs:
- **Group by author**: renames/moves files into `Author/` directories
- **Extract metadata**: dumps metadata CSV/JSON for inspection
- **Find duplicates by identifier**: detects duplicate EPUBs via ISBN/UUID metadata
- **GUI mode**: Tkinter-based desktop interface (compiled to `.exe` via PyInstaller on Windows)
- **CLI mode**: `cli.py` entry point with progress bars

## Tech stack

| Layer | Tech |
|---|---|
| Language | Python 3 |
| EPUB metadata | ebookmeta 1.2.11 |
| Progress display | progress 1.6.1 |
| GUI | tkinter (stdlib) |
| Packaging | PyInstaller 6.19 (`.exe` build) |
| Linting | ruff |
| CI | GitHub Actions |
| Pre-commit | pre-commit hooks |
| Versioning | GitVersion |

## Repository structure

```
cli.py          CLI entry point (uses Common base class)
gui.py          Tkinter GUI entry point
main.py         Script entry point / arg parser
common.py       Base class: get_processed_epub, get_metadata, rename_author, extract_metadata
requirements.txt
build.ps1       PowerShell script to build .exe via PyInstaller
Makefile
GitVersion.yml
.pre-commit-config.yaml
cliff.toml      Changelog generator config
```

## Development workflow

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# CLI usage
python main.py --epub-path /path/to/epub/folder <command>

# Available commands (from cli.py):
#   author_group            — group EPUBs into Author/ directories
#   extract_metadata        — dump metadata
#   find_duplicate_by_identifier  — find duplicates by ISBN/UUID

# Build Windows executable
pwsh build.ps1
```

## Key conventions

- `Common` base class in `common.py` contains all filesystem + metadata logic
- `Cli` and `Gui` classes inherit from `Common`
- Progress bars via `IncrementalBar` from the `progress` package
- `get_processed_epub()` returns filtered EPUB file list from `self.epub_path`
- `get_metadata(epub)` calls `ebookmeta.get_metadata(filepath)`
- `rename_author(epub, metadata)` builds `Author/` directory path from metadata

## Notes / known issues

- No README description yet — `README.md` has `TODO: Add description`
- Windows-only for GUI mode (win11toast not applicable here; Tkinter is used)
- PyInstaller 6.19 — check for updates before next release
- No unit tests currently
- ruff configured but no `ruff.toml` — uses tool defaults
- SonarCloud not configured

## Skills

Shared skills from `shared-standards/.claude/skills/`:

- `ui-ux/SKILL.md` — UX/UI/ergonomics across ALL surfaces (web, CLI, VS Code, Discord, desktop, game, agent) + WCAG 2.1 AA + dark mode + i18n FR+EN (load when building any human-facing surface)

# chrysa — Transverse Standards (core)

> The **slim always-on core**. The canonical, tool-agnostic source of truth is `standards/STANDARDS.chrysa.md`; the normative annexes live under `standards/annexes/`. Each rule below is a one-line pointer — its full text lives in the per-domain file named beside the heading (`standards/rules/<domain>.md`), read on demand.

**Where an annexe and the canon disagree, the canon wins.**

### Governance, language & compliance · `standards/rules/governance.md`
- Normative annexes
- Language
- Compliance targets
- Governance — strategic pillars & ADR format

### Cross-cutting stack · `standards/rules/stack.md`
- Cross-cutting stack (settled ADRs — do not relitigate)

### SCM — branches, commits & pull requests · `standards/rules/scm.md`
- Commits
- Branches
- Branch model — `main` is production, `develop` is the workspace
- Merge
- One PR per issue
- Issues and PRs are type-driven

### Architecture, decoupling & portability · `standards/rules/architecture.md`
- Repo provenance — every code repo depends on `project-init`
- Every repo declares its profile and DDD level
- Projects talk through versioned contracts only
- Everything is machine-agnostic and portable — no rule, repo, or script is bound to one machine
- Every external server the service talks to is addressed through the environment — never hardcoded
- Every tracked file and folder must earn its place — a repo holds only what is useful to it now
- The repository architecture is legible to an agent — optimised for Claude, not only for humans
- Deferred work is a governed job, not a fire-and-forget

### Testing · `standards/rules/testing.md`
- Tests: pytest only
- Frontend tests: Vitest + Testing Library + MSW — from the scaffold, not later

### Frontend & web semantics · `standards/rules/frontend.md`
- TypeScript is strict by contract
- The JS/TS package manager is `pnpm` — `npm` and `yarn` are forbidden
- React is a presentation layer, not the domain
- The frontend says when the backend is unreachable or unstable
- The frontend is reactive and real-time by default
- UI state survives reload & focus
- Everything is semantic — the markup, the data, and the URLs
- URL-addressable frontend navigation — mandatory

### APIs, contracts & real-time · `standards/rules/api.md`
- A real-time backend has channel contracts and never blocks
- APIs, SDKs & public contracts follow the `STD-API-001` contract

### Accessibility · `standards/rules/accessibility.md`
- Dark mode
- Every site is usable by the majority of disabilities — not only the screen-reader case

### Documentation & session state · `standards/rules/docs.md`
- Notion logging
- Documentation and Notion are maintained in lockstep with the code — a change that leaves them stale is unfinished
- Session lifecycle (primer + memory + hindsight)

### AI agents & features · `standards/rules/agents.md`
- Agent actions are governed
- An AI feature is evaluated, not just shipped
- An agent writes only where the owner owns

### Security, identity & sessions · `standards/rules/security.md`
- Per-person data implies a user account — no exceptions dressed up as simplicity
- Identity goes through the cluster SSO first
- A session is secured and it expires
- Every form is a hostile input surface — validate on the server, always

### Code quality & anti-patterns · `standards/rules/code-quality.md`
- No hardcoded constants
- No literal HTTP status codes — use the constants the framework already ships
- No code duplication — the second occurrence is an extraction order
- Raised errors are typed
- Failures are contained, and observable
- Prefer a lookup table to a state machine
- Decompose into small, independently unit-testable methods
- Code is read far more often than it is written — optimise for the reader, and standardise the form
- Avoid lambdas and anonymous constructs — a named function is the default
- Basic optimisations and known anti-patterns are caught in review and in CI
- A cache is a correctness contract, not a sprinkle of speed
- Quality gates
- Error handling pattern (all automations)

### Backend Python · `standards/rules/backend-python.md`
- Python packaging — `pyproject.toml` is the single source of truth
- Python is written object-oriented, one class per file
- Import the item, not the module — `from x import y; y()`
- Functions and methods are called with named arguments — positional call sites are the exception, not the rule

### Data, persistence & migrations · `standards/rules/data.md`
- Data, persistence & migrations follow the `STD-DATA-001` contract

### Observability & operations · `standards/rules/observability.md`
- Observability & production readiness follow the `STD-OPS-001` contract
- The container is versioned separately from the application it hosts, and an admin can see what is actually deployed
- Observability — error-tracking → GitHub issues (norm)

### Containers & compose · `standards/rules/containers.md`
- Everything runs in a container — the only exception is the slice of a repo genuinely bound to the host OS
- External dependencies are installed in containers, never on the host
- No virtualenv in a repo — ever
- Tool caches & deps never touch the project tree
- Dockerfiles are multi-stage, with a `production` and a `dev` stage — mandatory
- App containers ship the app only — the platform layer is the owner's responsibility
- Only a publicly useful port is published — everything else stays on the container network
- A compose file is minimal — declare only what the stack needs, default the rest
- Dev stage must hot-reload
- Local dev runs the code in-container, live, in debug mode — never the production server
- `.dockerignore` mandatory & exhaustive
- Container-runtime policy

### Product surfaces · `standards/rules/product.md`
- Setup wizard & config panel
- A game is DRM-free and fully playable solo offline
- Every product that is operated ships a management backoffice
- If a user can supply a file, the product accepts an upload
- A floating assistant where it earns its place — never as decoration

### Design system · `standards/rules/design.md`
- Design system

### Developer loop & tooling · `standards/rules/dev-loop.md`
- Makefile targets
- Shared skills (load on demand from shared-standards/.claude/skills/)

### CI/CD, pre-commit & release · `standards/rules/ci-cd.md`
- Release & changelog config (canonical)
- GitHub Actions (reuse first · custom actions centralised · thin workflows)
- Pre-commit & git hooks (native, via pre-commit.com — never wrapped in make)
